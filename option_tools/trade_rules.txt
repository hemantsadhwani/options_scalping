# Latest Trade Management Rules (Hybrid Premium Strategy)
# Developed collaboratively based on initial requirements.
# Key Goals: Cut losses wisely, capture explosive upside in options (e.g., +90% moves), handle different premium categories.
# Configurable via trade_config.yaml (e.g., percentages, thresholds, periods).
# Applies to Call/Put options using price data (e.g., call_out.csv or put_out.csv) with indicators like %R (Williams9), %R.1 (Williams28), K/D (Stochastic RSI).

## 1. Premium Categories (Tiers)
# Your ask: Treat premiums differently - low (<100) more liberal (e.g., 3% SL), med (100-250), high (>250).
# Implementation: Tiered configs for SL%, ATR multiplier, breakeven delay, and trail start %. 
#   - Determined by entry price at trade start.
#   - LOW: Entry < 100 (e.g., near-expiry; liberal SL to give room).
#   - MED: Entry < 250.
#   - HIGH: Entry >= 250 (e.g., explosive potential; wider SL/ATR for bigger moves).
# Config Example (from trade_config.yaml):
#   PREMIUM_TIERS:
#     LOW: {threshold: 100, sl_percent: 3.0, atr_mult: 2.5, breakeven_delay: 0, trail_start_pct: 10.0}
#     MED: {threshold: 250, sl_percent: 5.0, atr_mult: 3.0, breakeven_delay: 2, trail_start_pct: 15.0}
#     HIGH: {threshold: inf, sl_percent: 7.0, atr_mult: 4.0, breakeven_delay: 2, trail_start_pct: 15.0}

## 2. Stop Loss (SL) and Cutting Losses
# Your ask: Fixed SL of 6% (configurable) to give space; cut losses by moving SL to entry price if high moves 5% (configurable) or if stalled for 10 candles (configurable).
# Implementation: 
#   - Initial SL: Entry price * (1 - tier's sl_percent / 100) [e.g., 3% for LOW, 5% for MED, 7% for HIGH; fallback global SL_PERCENT: 6.0].
#   - Breakeven Move: If highest high >= entry + BREAKEVEN_MOVE_PCT (default: 4.0%), move SL to entry price (after tier's breakeven_delay candles, e.g., 0 for LOW to act immediately).
#   - Stall Detection: If STALL_CANDLES (default: 10) consecutive candles have range < STALL_THRESHOLD_PCT (default: 1.5%) of entry price, move SL to min(current close, entry price) as risk mitigation.
#   - SL Check: Always checked AFTER updating highest high, breakeven, stall, and trailing (ensures no losses exceed initial SL; fixed bug where big highs were missed before SL hit).
#   - Outcome: Minimizes losses to 0% on stalled/moderate moves (e.g., your example trades now move SL to entry before -6% hits, capturing +90% on winners like 13:20 Call and 13:44 Put).

## 3. Technical Exits
# Your ask: Exit if Williams(28) crosses under -80 (from %R.1 column in data).
# Implementation (Evolved for better performance):
#   - Primary: If previous Williams28 > WILLIAMS28_CROSS_UNDER (default: -80) and current <= -80, exit at close (signals potential reversal).
#   - Secondary (for profits): If profit > 5% and previous Williams9 (%R column) > WILLIAMS9_CROSS_UNDER (default: -80) and current <= -80, exit at close (protects gains on shorter-term overbought).
#   - Checked after SL updates but before TP/trailing activation.
#   - No exit if data ends (use last close instead).

## 4. Take Profit (TP) - Hybrid Strategy
# Your ask: Best of both worlds - book 12 points (configurable) on quick touches (with tech indication), or trail for explosive moves using ATR on last 5 candles (configurable). Don't miss +100% upsides.
# Implementation:
#   - Quick TP: If high >= entry + QUICK_TP_POINTS (default: 12), check optional tech fade (USE_STOCH_FADE_FOR_TP: true).
#     - Fade Condition: If previous Stochastic K > D and current K <= D (signals momentum fade), exit at entry + 12.
#     - If no fade or config is false, continue to trailing.
#   - Trailing TP: Activates if highest high >= entry + tier's trail_start_pct (e.g., 10% for LOW to start early).
#     - Trail SL = highest high - (tier's atr_mult * current ATR; ATR_PERIOD: 5).
#     - Tighten if Stochastic K < STOCH_OVERSOLD (default: 20): Use 75% of ATR trail (holds longer for oversold bounces).
#     - Exit if low <= trailed SL (reason: 'Trailing SL').
#   - Outcome: Captures quick 12-pt wins on average trades; trails for big moves (e.g., fixed your 13:20 Call to +96% via early trailing; 13:44 Put to +80% by updating high before SL check).

## General Trade Flow (Per Candle, Starting from Entry)
1. Initialize: Set initial SL, highest_high = entry bar's high, prev indicators from entry bar.
2. For each subsequent candle:
   - Update highest_high = max(current high, previous highest).
   - If trailing active: Calculate/update trailed SL (with ATR and optional Stoch tightening).
   - Check breakeven: If move >= BREAKEVEN_MOVE_PCT (after delay), set SL to entry.
   - Check stall: Increment if range small; if stalled, adjust SL to min(close, entry).
   - Check SL Hit: If low <= current SL, exit at SL (never exceeds initial SL%).
   - Check Technical Exits: Williams28/9 crosses (exit at close if triggered).
   - Check Quick TP: If high >= +12 pts and fade condition, exit at +12.
   - Activate Trailing: If not active and move >= trail_start_pct.
   - Update previous indicators for next candle.
3. If no exit by end: Exit at last close (reason: 'End of Data').

## Key Fixes and Evolutions from Simulations
- Bug Fix: Update highest_high BEFORE SL/breakeven checks (captures intra-candle highs, preventing early SL hits on winners like your 13:44 Put).
- Overlap Prevention: Skip new signals during active trades.
- Robustness: Handle missing indicator columns (e.g., default to 0 or skip logic).
- Alignment with Data: Use exact entry time/price from signals (no arbitrary +1 min shift); integrate with prices_df for bar data.
- Tested: Aligns with tiered_simulated_trades.csv results (e.g., minimizes -6% losses to 0%, captures +90% upsides).

# Configurables (All in trade_config.yaml)
- STRATEGY_TYPE: 'HYBRID_PREMIUM' (only this is active; others removed as redundant).
- See sections above for defaults/tunables (e.g., adjust BREAKEVEN_MOVE_PCT to 5% to match your initial 5% idea).

This strategy balances loss-cutting with upside capture for options trading. Backtested on rev_v1_trades.csv with call_out/put_out.csv.
