can you help me improvising the way we give input and save output to the run_s1r1_crp_filter.py. Since the standard input file "tradeview_utc_output.csv" is converted into "tradeview_rev_output.csv" & "tradeview_cont_output.csv". Check if files exists use them as input one by one. Also, instead of creating the new or intermediate output please make all the filtered call and put signals from 1 to 0 in "tradeview_rev_output.csv" & "tradeview_cont_output.csv".  for "tradeview_rev_output.csv" you must check Call/Call_v2 & Put/Put_v2
