I am trying to improve ./option_tools/option_trade_executor.py so going step by step. I have updated the code with ./option_tppls/trade_rules.txt (these are my trade managemant rules).
Also, ive current implemented the trade_rules.txt ./optio_tools/option_trade_executor.py & ./option_tools/trade_config.yaml

I am currently focusing on improving the ./data/1407/. instead changing the app.py better to write shall test file which 
reads call/put signals from ./data/1407/tradeview_rev_output.csv "Call_crp" & "Put_crp" and take respective trades+next candle on ./data/1407/call/call_out.csv
and ./data/1407/put/put_out.csv. This should generate ./data/1407/trades_crp/rev_v1_trades.csv. 

Core objective is to create a test file which can use attached files to improve or build profitable strategy using trade_rules.txt inplemented in option_trade_executor.py

Current  ./data/1407/trades_crp/rev_v1_trades.csv is hugely loss making - how we can improve?



There is no point in running CRP filter on signals generated from running ./strategies/run_rev2_strategy.py. As they are already delayed.
Can you make a small change while running ./option_tools/option_trade_executor.py - instead using "Put_v2_crp" from tradeview_rev_output.csv use
"Put_v2". This small change simply bypase the crp filter on rev_v2 strategy

Can you help me debug? ./data/1107/ condition become true on ./strategies/run_rev2_strategy.py become true 9:46 however Put_v2 = 1 in ./data/1107/tradeview_rev_output.csv

This bring is to million dollor issue. How we can diffrentiate between average signals where we can fixed take profit of 12 points and still be winner.
And another point comes when we should trail the trend. for example
 Entry Time	Entry Price	Exit Time	Exit Price	P/L	P/L %	Exit Reason	Trade Type	Initial SL	Final SL	Highest High
11/07/25 9:52	75	11/07/25 10:08	83.37	8.37	11.16%	Trailing SL	Put Option (Hybrid Premium)	63.75	83.37	90.3

for example while this signal exited at 
11/07/2025  9:52:00 AM but if we have identified the trade for big move based on some (to be researched) 
parameter or technical indicators this trade fetched. We lost nearly 80+ %
11/07/25 11:09	137.8	146.75	137.5	144	46.18324375	39.60028699	-15.10989011	-5.759162304
Then we could have trail this signal until the ema 15 & emap 9 bullish cross over would have happened. 

Since we have to research - create a new debbug file
reading ./data/1107/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv for time stamps of all signals, ohlc data with StochRSI(K,D), William(9) as %R and William(9) as %R.1 ./data/1107/put/put_out.csv 

Lets read in debbug file ./data/1107/option_tools/execute option_trade_executor.py, trade_config.yaml & trade_rules.txt (to be improvised)

I am trying to improve date by date using file debug_trade_analysis.py and comparing improved output with existing put_rev_v2_trades.csv 

You can remove the paths as i have shared all files for testing


Indeed you have improved ./data/1507/call/trades/call_rev_v2_trades.csv. If i generalise same on ./data/1407/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
Trade on 10:31 was big move which is FALSE
14/07/25 10:31	101.5	14/07/25 10:43	102.9	1.4	1.38%	Williams Exit	Put Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	95.41	101.5	113.2	FALSE

And all 3 below BigMove = True hit SL @ 14/07/25 12:48, 14/07/25 14:37, 14/07/25 15:11

Can you compare put on 11 and 14 as what parameter needs tune ?

While making changes 
./data/1507/call/trades/call_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1107/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
looks steady and should not detoriate especially No of BigMoves = True

However, i still dont agree with 
./data/1407/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
14/07/25 10:31	101.5	14/07/25 10:56	101.5	0	0.00%	SL Hit	Put Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	95.41	101.5	113.2	TRUE

Now 10:31 is True with 0%?? However if you check the trailing price went upto 11:43
14/07/25 11:43	133.7	135.75	132.2	135.4	61.69653818	36.36188397	-2.868852459	-1.361867704

Also, other BigMove = True have SL??

My understanding was we are building a logic to reach QuickTP and there we decide to come out or trail. So worst we should have got QuickTP

I dont see a fix, I still see it exits just at approx 13% where as trade could have trailed until 11:09
11/07/25 11:09	137.8	146.75	137.5	144	46.18324375	39.60028699	-15.10989011	-5.759162304

What we are trying to build is a system of a trade management, which identify Average Signals with BigMove. For avarage Signals
it tries to minimize losses and book Fixed Price 10 points. And for BigMove trail the move (ATR or EMA)

We know for 3 dates (Call & put) where the BigMoves are there. And trying to build system for us to identify some how average signals from big moves. 
And once BigMove is identifies trail as much as possible or worst case take QuickTP.

You must carefully read the existing trading logic and if trade_config
./option_tools/option_trade_executor.py & ./option_tools/trade_config.yaml

I'll list all important BigMoves trades from 1107,1407 & 1507 with capturing the bigmoves with trailing logic

./data/1507/call/trades/call_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1507/call/call_out.csv
15/07/25 14:12	140	15/07/25 14:37	131.6	-8.4	-6.00%	SL Hit	Call Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	131.6	131.6	147.2	TRUE
15/07/25 14:42	138.5	15/07/25 14:46	130.19	-8.31	-6.00%	SL Hit	Call Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	130.19	130.19	139.3	FALSE
15/07/25 15:03	135.65	15/07/25 15:29	167.8	32.15	23.70%	End of Data	Call Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	127.51	153.42	170.85	TRUE

./data/1107/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1107/put/put_out.csv
I am pretty much focused on improving 
Entry Time	Entry Price	Exit Time	Exit Price	P/L	P/L %	Exit Reason	Trade Type	Initial SL	Final SL	Highest High	Big Move
11/07/25 9:52	75	11/07/25 10:04	85	10	13.33%	Trailing SL	Put Option (Advanced Hybrid Premium)	70.5	85	90.1	TRUE
While this is exiting with mere 13% but by carefully looking at trading logs in ./data/1107/put/put_out.csv trade could have easily trailled until Approx 11:09 ~146
datetime	open	high	low	close	K	D	%R	%R.1
11/07/25 11:09	137.8	146.75	137.5	144	46.18324375	39.60028699	-15.10989011	-5.759162304

./data/1407/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1407/put/put_out.csv
Please read ./data/1407/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv. i am broadly OK with current BigMoves

I strongly recommend to develop strategy keeping in mind 
./data/1107/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1407/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv
./data/1507/call/trades/call_rev_v2_trades.csv

Shall we improve ./data/1107/put/trades/put_rev_v2_trades.csv 9:52 ?



I am super impressed with ENHANCED_TRADING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY.md. Can we work to getehr to build a enhanced trading system for SL also. Which keeps eating our profit. 
We can analyse all the "SL Hit " in 1107, 1407 & 1507 and see if we can build a technical (StochRSI(K,D), William(9) as %R, William(28) as %R.1 Ema 9 or 15) 
or advance mechanism which traders use?

I would encourage to see what happens between entry and exit time for below trades from which we can build insigts using external experence to minimise max extent without hurting our winners

i would encorage to build another file ENHANCED_TRADING_SYSTEM_SUMMARY_FOR_SL.md
