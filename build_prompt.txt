I am trying to improve ./option_tools/option_trade_executor.py so going step by step. I have updated the code with ./option_tppls/trade_rules.txt (these are my trade managemant rules).
Also, ive current implemented the trade_rules.txt ./optio_tools/option_trade_executor.py & ./option_tools/trade_config.yaml

I am currently focusing on improving the ./data/1407/. instead changing the app.py better to write shall test file which 
reads call/put signals from ./data/0307/tradeview_rev_output.csv "Call_crp" & "Put_crp" and take respective trades+next candle on ./data/0307/call/call_out.csv
and ./data/0307/put/put_out.csv. This should generate ./data/0307/trades_crp/rev_v1_trades.csv. 

Core objective is to create a test file which can use attached files to improve or build profitable strategy using trade_rules.txt inplemented in option_trade_executor.py

Current rev_v1_trades.csv is hugely loss making
