Here are the precise rules for CPR filtering:

For a Call Trade:

S1/PDL Support Zone:
Bottom of zone = min(Daily S1, Prev Day low) 
Top of zone = max(Daily S1, Prev Day Low) + proximity_pct
Call Trade PASSES if any candle's LOW enters "Support Zone", regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a support level for price, making it a valid area for call reversals.

R1/PDH Support Zone:
Bottom of zone = min(Daily R1, Prev Day High)
Top of zone = max(Daily R1, Prev Day High) + proximity_pct
Call Trade PASSES if any candle's LOW enters this zone AND price is falling.
This zone acts as a support level when price is falling.

Pivot/TC Support Zone:
Bottom of zone = Daily Pivot
Top of zone = Daily TC + proximity_pct
Call Trade PASSES if any candle's LOW enters this zone, regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a support level for price, making it a valid area for call reversals.

For a Put Trade:

R1/PDH Resistance Zone:
Bottom of zone = min(Daily R1, Prev Day High) - proximity_pct
Top of zone = max(Daily R1, Prev Day High)
Put Trade PASSES if any candle's HIGH enters "R1/PDH Resistance Zone", regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a resistance level for price, making it a valid area for put reversals.

S1/PDL Resistance Zone:
Bottom of zone = min(Daily S1, Prev Day Low) - proximity_pct
Top of zone = max(Daily S1, Prev Day Low)
Put Trade PASSES if any candle's HIGH enters this zone AND price is rising.
This zone acts as a resistance level when price is rising.

Pivot/BC Resistance Zone:
Bottom of zone = Daily BC - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily Pivot
Put Trade PASSES if any candle's HIGH enters this zone, regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a resistance level for price, making it a valid area for put reversals.

Extended Support/Resistance Zones:

R2/R3/R4 Resistance or Support Zones (irrespective of price direction):
Bottom of zone = Daily R2/Daily R3/Daily R4 - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily R2/Daily R3/Daily R4 + proximity_pct
These zones act as resistance & support levels for high or low of price, making them valid areas for put or call reversals.
- For Put trades: Check if candle's HIGH is within any of these zones
- For Call trades: Check if candle's LOW is within any of these zones

S2/S3/S4 Resistance or Support Zones (irrespective of price direction):
Bottom of zone = Daily S2/Daily S3/Daily S4 - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily S2/Daily S3/Daily S4 + proximity_pct
These zones act as resistance & support levels for high or low of price, making them valid areas for put or call reversals.
- For Put trades: Check if candle's HIGH is within any of these zones
- For Call trades: Check if candle's LOW is within any of these zones

Note: 
- proximity_pct is set to 0.03 (3%) to create wider bands that help catch price bouncing or rejecting
- For primary zones (S1/PDL for Calls, R1/PDH for Puts), trend direction is not required
- For secondary zones (R1/PDH for Calls, S1/PDL for Puts), trend direction confirmation is required
- For extended zones (R2/R3/R4 and S2/S3/S4), trend direction is not required as they act as both support and resistance
