Here are the precise rules for CPR filtering when CPR Width > 50:

For a Call Trade:

Pivot/TC Support Zone:
Bottom of zone = Daily Pivot
Top of zone = Daily TC + proximity_pct
Call Trade PASSES if any candle's LOW enters this zone, regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a support level for price, making it a valid area for call reversals.

For a Put Trade:

Pivot/BC Resistance Zone:
Bottom of zone = Daily BC - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily Pivot
Put Trade PASSES if any candle's HIGH enters this zone, regardless of trend direction.
This zone acts as a resistance level for price, making it a valid area for put reversals.

Extended Support/Resistance Zones:

PDH/R1/R2/R3/R4 Resistance or Support Zones (irrespective of price direction):
Bottom of zone = Daily PDH/Daily R1/Daily R2/Daily R3/Daily R4 - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily PDH/Daily R1/Daily R2/Daily R3/Daily R4 + proximity_pct
These zones act as resistance & support levels for high or low of price, making them valid areas for put or call reversals.
- For Put trades: Check if candle's HIGH or LOW is within any of these zones
- For Call trades: Check if candle's LOW or HIGH is within any of these zones

PDL/S1/S2/S3/S4 Resistance or Support Zones (irrespective of price direction):
Bottom of zone = Daily PDL/Daily S1/Daily S2/Daily S3/Daily S4 - proximity_pct
Top of zone = Daily PDL/Daily S1/Daily S2/Daily S3/Daily S4 + proximity_pct
These zones act as resistance & support levels for high or low of price, making them valid areas for put or call reversals.
- For Put trades: Check if candle's HIGH or LOW is within any of these zones
- For Call trades: Check if candle's LOW or HIGH is within any of these zones

Note: 
- proximity_pct is set to 0.06 (6%) to create wider bands that help catch price bouncing or rejecting
- For wide CPR bands (>50), all primary zones (S1, PDL, R1, PDH) are treated as independent zones without trend direction requirements
- Pivot/TC and Pivot/BC zones remain as primary zones regardless of trend direction
- Extended zones (R2/R3/R4 and S2/S3/S4) are treated as both support and resistance without trend direction requirements
